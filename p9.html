    <p>An equation that has maximum degree one is known as Linear Equations. The graph of it is a straight line.</p>
    <p>For example,</p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            y=8 x- 2
        </li>
        <li>
            ax<sub> 1</sub>+ bx<sub> 2</sub>- cx<sub> 3</sub>= 9
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>are some of the examples of a linear equation in two and three variables.</p>

    <p>
         y<sub>1</sub>=m x <sub>1</sub> + a and <br>
         y<sub>2</sub>=m x <sub>2</sub> + b
    </p>
    <p>for the points P(x1, y1) and Q(x2, y2) is:</p>
    <p>m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)</p>
